# Project Euler Problems

## This is my repository for Euler solutions in JavaScript and Python

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) (pronounced Oiler) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems meant to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational manner.

The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose one to a new concept that allows one to undertake a previously inaccessible problem.

Although mathematics will help one arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
